# Twoopstracker


## MOVED

All current and future development of TwoopsTracker has been moved to it's new home, amongst other civic tech tools: the Code for Africa's [Commons API](https://github.com/CodeForAfrica/api/) monorepo[^1].

## About
A Twitter-based disinformation tracking tool built on a web-based dashboard that collects deleted tweet content from previously identified trolls and disinformation actors. The project seeks to help monitor the social posts of known disinfo actors. The primary tangible output of the project is to expose trolls behind toxic disinformation campaigns who routinely cover their tracks by deleting original inflammatory social media posts that sparked hate speech, disinformation campaigns or conspiracy theories.
